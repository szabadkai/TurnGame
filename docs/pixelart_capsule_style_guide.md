## Quick Style Lessons

### Visual Tone & Palette
- **Warm, expressive palettes** (e.g., Stardew Valley) evoke emotional familiarity.
- **Strong silhouettes and contrast** (e.g., Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter) highlight characters per pixel.
- **Bold, punchy colors** (e.g., Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors) energize action and clarity.

### Detail vs. Simplicity
- **Minimal but iconic sprites** (Undertale) allow players to emotionally invest what's not rendered.
- **Highly detailed backgrounds** (Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter) support immersion without overcrowding the main focus area.

### Motion & Composition
- **Fluid animation and visual exaggeration** (Pizza Tower) inject dynamic personality.
- **Atmospheric lighting and bloom effects** (Hyper Light Drifter) blend retro charm with cinematic depth.

### Framing & Mood
- **Cinematic wide shots** with central figures and layered environments (Hyper Light Drifter, Terraria) draw focus.
- **Narratively meaningful framing** (Undertale’s character-focused shots) edit closer to emotional stakes.

## Style Guide for Your Capsule Image

| Element              | Recommendation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Color Palette**    | Use warm oranges and purples for twilight, punctuated by the ethereal glow of blue portal light. High contrast creates mystery and focus. |
| **Silhouette & Focus** | Craft strong, easy-to-read silhouettes: the female astronaut in crisp gear, crew shadows around her, the ship partly lit by portal glow. |
| **Detail Balance**   | Keep characters moderately simple—stitch in unique details like reflective visors or tech accents. Surround with lush foliage and alien plants reminiscent of Terraria-style environments. |
| **Lighting Effects** | Integrate dramatic light: cool portal glow versus warm sunset. Use subtle bloom or rim-lighting to define forms in pixel art. |
| **Composition & Framing** | Cinematic 21:9 framing: low-angle perspective looking upward toward the portal. Foliage should frame sides, also drawing eyes inward. |
| **Animation Potential** | Even if static, design with fluidity in mind: a slight glint on visors, subtle motion lines in the portal, slight foliage sway. Think Pizza Tower energy. |
| **Stylistic Flavor** | Marry retro pixel aesthetics with cinematic polish—there’s precedent in games like Hyper Light Drifter and newer titles embracing “hi‑bit” wider ratios. |
