4. User Experience
   4.1 Player Journey

First Access: Tutorial tooltip explaining star map navigation
Exploration: Discover new systems unlock as story progresses
Choice Points: Faction decisions affect available paths
Completion: All systems accessible for free exploration

4.2 Accessibility

Visual Clarity: High contrast between locked/unlocked states
Text Readability: Clear fonts with sufficient size
Color Independence: Don't rely solely on color for state indication
Consistent Interaction: Standard hover/click behaviors

4.3 Performance Considerations

Efficient Rendering: Minimize draw calls for static elements
Smooth Animations: 60fps target for hover effects
Quick Loading: Instant tooltip display, fast scene transitions

5. Integration Points
   5.1 Save System Integration

Persistence: Save unlocked systems, visited status, current location
State Restoration: Properly restore star map state on game load
Cross-Session: Maintain progress between game sessions

5.2 Narrative System

Story Triggers: Unlock systems based on dialog choices
Faction Tracking: Display faction control based on player actions
Branch Support: Handle multiple story paths through different systems

5.3 Combat Integration

6. Success Metrics
   6.1 Usability Goals

Discoverability: Players can immediately understand how to interact
Efficiency: Less than 2 seconds to access system information
Error Prevention: Clear visual feedback prevents invalid actions

6.2 Engagement Targets

Exploration: Players visit all available systems

Basic star system objects and positioning
Hover detection and tooltip display
Click handling and scene transitions

7.2 Phase 2: Visual Polish (Week 3-4)

Implement all visual states and animations
Add background and atmospheric effects
Create and integrate audio elements

7.3 Phase 3: System Integration (Week 5-6)

Connect to save/load system

8. Risk Mitigation
   8.1 Technical Risks

Performance: Complex tooltips may impact frame rate

Mitigation: Use object pooling and efficient draw events

Complexity: Integration with multiple systems increases bug risk

Mitigation: Modular design with clear interfaces

8.2 Design Risks

Information Overload: Too much tooltip information may overwhelm

Mitigation: Progressive disclosure, essential info only

Navigation Confusion: Players may not understand progression

Mitigation: Clear visual hierarchy and tutorial guidance

This PRD aligns with your existing development tasks (ART-002, ART-003, ENG-003) while providing the specific Game Maker implementation details you requested for hoverable stars with information tooltips and scene transitions.
